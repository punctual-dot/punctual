## Description

**Punctual** is web application designed and developed by [Team Punctual](https://github.com/punctual-dot) to simply & honestly track that horrible time of month. The Punctual App also provides recommendations based on your mood.

## Motivation for Development

Each one of us found that every month we have challenges with our cycle. We all know to ease our symptoms and help with our mood that we should be eating healthier throughout our cycle. To help with that we wanted to create app that helps with these recommendations. The app will also be straightforward and sassier compared to the more delicate and feminine apps that we each currently use.

## Application Concept

Our app will allow our users to track their menstrual cycles and will provide food recommendations based on their mood. The calendar feature will allow the user historically review their cycle.
